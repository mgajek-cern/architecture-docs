**DEPRECATED**

## 3. Data Discovery Service Integration (Task 2.3)

**Technical Concept:** Popularity-driven intelligent caching with federated metadata

**Key Files to Modify:**

* `lib/rucio/core/did.py` - Add popularity metadata fields and update logic
  *// Medium complexity — Extend DID model and scoring logic*
* `lib/rucio/core/rule.py` - Popularity-triggered rule creation
  *// Medium complexity — New rule creation logic based on popularity scores*
* `lib/rucio/core/subscription.py` - Subscribe to popularity events
  *// Low complexity — Extend existing subscription model*
* `lib/rucio/daemons/judge/injector.py` - Integrate popularity-based injection
  *// Medium complexity — Modify daemon to create/populate rules*
* `lib/rucio/web/rest/flaskapi/v1/dids.py` - Expose DID popularity metadata and federated metadata endpoints
  *// Low complexity — New API endpoints needed*
* `lib/rucio/db/sqla/models.py` - Add popularity tracking and federated metadata tables
  *// Low complexity — Add new tables, migration required*

**New Components Needed:**

* Popularity service client interface
  *// Medium complexity — Service to fetch/process popularity data*
* Intelligent caching algorithm module
  *// Medium complexity — Algorithm for scoring and cache placement*
* Metadata federation service
  *// Medium complexity — Sync federated metadata from external sources*

**Feasibility Assessment: MODERATE RISK**

* **Performance impact:** Moderate, due to additional scoring and metadata sync
* **Architectural fit:** Good, modular and extensible with existing Rucio patterns
* **Backward compatibility:** Low risk; feature can be toggled via config
* **Development effort:** Estimated 4-6 months for stable release
* **Operational complexity:** Moderate; requires monitoring and tuning popularity thresholds
* **Security considerations:** Low risk; metadata validation and access control required

**Recommendation:** Implement incrementally — start with popularity tracking and rule injection, then add federation support. Use feature flags to minimize risk during rollout.
