### 🔧 **"Grid workflows" in short:**

> **Coordinated sequences of tasks** (like data transfers, job executions, staging) that run across **distributed computing resources** — typically on a **computational grid**.

### 🧠 Breaking it down:

| Term              | What it means                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grid**          | A network of **distributed compute and storage sites** (often across institutions or countries), linked to work together. |
| **Workflow**      | A **defined sequence of operations** — e.g. move data → run analysis → store results.                                     |
| **Grid Workflow** | A workflow that runs **across this grid**, coordinating compute and data movement between sites.                          |

### 🧪 Example from science:

Imagine CERN or a large physics lab:

1. Raw data is collected from detectors.
2. It is transferred to Tier-1 sites via **FTS**.
3. Analysis jobs run on Tier-2 compute clusters via **HTCondor** or **PanDA**.
4. Results are stored back in long-term storage.
5. Monitoring tools track each step.

This whole orchestration — across dozens of locations — is a **grid workflow**.

### 💬 Why it’s called a “buzzword”:

People often say “grid workflows” without clarifying:

* What tools are used (e.g. FTS, Rucio, HTCondor)
* What the actual tasks are
* How it's orchestrated (e.g. workflow engines, DAGs)

So the term sounds more magical than it really is — it's just **distributed automation**.

---

### ✅ In one sentence:

> **A grid workflow is an automated process that moves and processes data across multiple distributed computing sites.**
