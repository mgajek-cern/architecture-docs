# Measurable Quality Requirements & Tests

*To be defined with stakeholders, example below*

## What makes them "requirements":
- **Quantifiable** - specific numbers, not vague terms
- **Testable** - can be measured/validated
- **Stakeholder-driven** - based on business/operational needs
- **Contractual** - often become acceptance criteria
