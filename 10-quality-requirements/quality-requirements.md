# Measurable Quality Requirements & Tests

*To be defined with stakeholders, example below*

## What makes them "requirements":
- **Quantifiable** - specific numbers, not vague terms
- **Testable** - can be measured/validated
- **Stakeholder-driven** - based on business/operational needs
- **Contractual** - often become acceptance criteria

## Performance Efficiency

### Scale Requirements
**Metric:** Manage ≥1 exabyte total data volume, ≥1 billion files, ≥25 million containers
**Test:** Load test with simulated datasets reaching target volumes, measure catalog performance degradation

### Transfer Rates
**Metric:** Aggregate transfer rate ≥40 GB/s across all active transfers
**Test:** Concurrent large file transfers between multiple sites, monitor sustained throughput over 1+ hours

### API Response Time
**Metric:** 95th percentile response time <50ms for catalog queries under normal load (enhanced from <200ms generic requirement)
**Test:** Load testing with increasing concurrent requests, measure response time percentiles

### Resource Utilization
**Metric:** CPU <80%, Memory <85% during peak operations
**Test:** Resource monitoring during high-load scenarios, validate scaling triggers

### Concurrent Processing
**Metric:** Handle ≥10,000 concurrent file transfers without degradation (aligned with throughput requirement)
**Test:** Parallel transfer simulation across multiple sites with performance monitoring

### Concurrent Users
**Metric:** Support ≥1000 simultaneous authenticated API connections without performance degradation
**Test:** Concurrent user simulation with realistic workload patterns, measure throughput and error rates

## Reliability

### High Availability
**Metric:** System remains operational with ≤2 minutes downtime during single component failure
**Test:** Chaos engineering tests (kill pods, disconnect databases), measure recovery time and data consistency

### Overall Availability
**Metric:** 99.9% uptime (≤8.77 hours downtime per year)
**Test:** Long-running availability monitoring over 6+ months, automated health checks every 30 seconds

### Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
**Metric:** <30 minutes for critical system recovery
**Test:** Simulated failure scenarios with recovery time measurement

### Data Integrity
**Metric:** 99.999% file transfer success rate with checksum validation
**Test:** Large-scale transfer campaigns with integrity verification and error rate analysis

### Geographic Distribution
**Metric:** Support ≥100 geographically distributed sites across ≥3 continents
**Test:** Multi-site deployment test with latency measurements between regions, failover testing

## Security

### Authentication
**Metric:** Multi-factor authentication required for administrative operations, X.509 certificate support for grid operations
**Test:** Authentication flow testing, certificate validation, session management verification

### Authorization
**Metric:** Role-based access control compliance with fine-grained permissions per dataset/container
**Test:** Access control matrix testing, privilege escalation prevention validation

### Audit Trail
**Metric:** 100% of data access, transfers, and administrative actions logged and retained for 2 years minimum
**Test:** Log completeness verification, retention policy validation, audit trail integrity checks

### Data Protection
**Metric:** All data transfers encrypted in transit, sensitive metadata encrypted at rest
**Test:** Network traffic analysis, encryption strength validation, key management testing

## Usability

### Learning Curve
**Metric:** New users complete basic file registration and transfer within 15 minutes using CLI tools
**Test:** User onboarding sessions with task completion time measurement

### API Usability
**Metric:** <5% user errors in common REST API workflows
**Test:** API usability testing with documentation validation, error message clarity assessment

### Documentation Quality
**Metric:** All REST APIs documented with working examples, response time for documentation updates <48 hours
**Test:** Documentation completeness audit, example code validation, user feedback analysis

## Maintainability

### Code Quality
**Metric:** >80% test coverage, static code analysis passing with <10 critical issues
**Test:** Automated code coverage reporting, continuous static analysis validation

### Deployment Efficiency
**Metric:** <10 minutes for routine updates, <30 minutes for major version deployments
**Test:** Deployment time measurement across environments, rollback procedure validation

### System Monitoring
**Metric:** 100% of critical services monitored with <5 minute alert response time
**Test:** Monitoring coverage audit, alert response time measurement, dashboard effectiveness validation

### Database Performance
**Metric:** Database queries <100ms for 95% of catalog operations, automated cleanup maintaining <1TB metadata growth per month
**Test:** Database performance profiling, cleanup job effectiveness measurement

## Portability
